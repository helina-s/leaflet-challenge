# leaflet-challenge

### Step 1: Basic Visualization
In this challenge, I created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. I used the following webpage (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to pick a data set to visualize.
The data marker reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by color and include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. 


### Step 2: More Data
In this step, I used a second dataset on the map I created to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. The second dataset was pulled from <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates> and visualized along side the original set of data.
