# leaflet-challenge
In this challenge, I'll create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
The data marker reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by color and include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
