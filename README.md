# leaflet-challenge
In this challenge, I created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.
The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. I used the following webpage (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) to pick a data set to visualize.
The data marker reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earthquake by color and include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked. 


### Level 2: More Data (Optional)

The USGS wants you to plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. You will need to pull in a second data set and visualize it along side your original set of data. Data on tectonic plates can be found at <https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates>.
